                                <p>The aim of this programme is to expose young men to positive role models and to help them make informed choices about their future. The event was held at uMdlamfe High School and involved both Grade 11 and 12 male learners.</p>
                                <p>Our guest speaker was ABI’s Marketing Coordinator, Mr Sifiso Manyana, who gave an inspirational lecture to his young audience, which covered issues of time management, respect of authority, choosing the right friends and also highlighting the role of a man in society.  Ms Thembile Jobe, CSI manager at Foskor represented the sponsors of the event highlighted the importance of education and choosing careers in scarce skills sectors. Dr ND Luthuli, Operations Director at Auspicious Elites covered the health issues that young men need to be weary of especially STIs and HIV/Aids.

                                <p>The Auspicious Elites Cair Fair is just one example of our educational programmes.  The event took place at Hlanganani Hall in Esikhaleni Township and was supported by the Department of Education.</p>
                                <p>The aim of the event was to inform grade 9 learners about the various career options available after matric and to prepare them adequately as they choose subjects to pursue in grade 10. Teachers and learners were advised by the representatives of various companies and institutions of higher learning on what the requirements are for their respective jobs.</p>
                                <p>SiyaQubeksa Forestry gave a presentation on opportunities available in the Forestry Industry. The Department of Clinical Technology at Durban University of Technology advised learners on what subjects to take if they wish to be a Clinical Technologist. The media and television industry was represented by 1KZNtv and Urban Brew Studios. There were also presentations from the Department pf Environmental Affairs in KZN, University of Zululand was represented by the Department of Hydrology from Stats SA Sourcing funds for this year’s event proved to be a real challenge. But through the support of the uMhlathuze Municipality’s Ward 19 Councillor and the Youth Council, we were able to pull through. ABI has supplied refreshments for the event since 2013 when the project was launched.</p>
                                <p>In 2015 they once again came to the party, supplying cooldrinks for the event. It was an honour to receive sponsorship from SiyaQubeka Forestry in the form of meals for exhibitors and T-shirts for the learners. GX Marketing provided the printing of the programmes which were beautifully designed by Mr T Maphosa.Auspicious Elites would like to thank all those who believe in our vision and support the work we do. We would like to urge more companies to come on board and support us in future. Shaping future leaders is our mission and without the support of business it would be impossible to achieve this goal.</p>
