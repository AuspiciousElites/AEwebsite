                    <p>
                        Auspicious Elites (AE) is a predominately female run, 100% owned
                        business. The company is primarily a marketing and events company
                        with plans aimed at providing young individuals with opportunities to use
                        their skills of expertise, thus providing them not only with experience in a
                        work environment but also further opportunities to explore the work force
                        as well as other avenues that they may come across.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Further AE aims to create opportunities of development amongst the
                        youth through out outreach programs. These programs will span from
                        skills development, career guidance to psychosocial support. AE will
                        render multiple services such as marketing, event planning/coordinating,

                        and giving guidance, for example assisting a client with getting their
                        clothing line off the ground, their book published or how to make social
                        media work for them to promote their product.

                        It is common in South Africa to have a business that focuses on youth
                        unemployment issues, but what sets AE apart from the rest is the fact
                        that we are not only looking specifically at youth unemployment but we
                        are also looking at psychosocial problems faced by South African youths
                        in general. This company aims to uplift the youth by building them up
                        from a young age, proving to them that it Is possible to be more that
                        what the stereotypes make you out to be. We aim to encourage young
                        individuals to continue pushing through the struggles that they face
                        because with hard work, nothing is impossible to achieve.
